### Things it does:

This is a simple command line noughts and crosses game.

 - You are a human, much like John Henry
 - Your opponent will be a machine, much like a Steam-Powered Drill
 - Your opponent will never lose, and will always play perfectly.(feature to be added)
 - Finally, you can feel what it's like to rage against the machine and never win!(feature to be added)

### How to play:

 1. `$ git clone git@github.com:IanDCarroll/xox.git`
 2. `$ cd xox/source/`
 3. `$ python xox.py`

### How to test:

 1. `$ git clone git@github.com:IanDCarroll/xox.git`
 2. `$ cd xox/`
 3. `$ nosetests-2.7`

## Suggestions?

Have ideas about how I can better defeat you with this program? Is there a bug you'd like to report? A duplication you see? A feature to request? Or is the readme unclear? (I'm afraid I cannot accept any PRs beside my own because this is a test from 8th Light.) But otherwise, all comments and help are welcome! <a href="https://github.com/IanDCarroll/tik-tak-toe/issues/new">Open up an issue!</a> :smile:
