### Things it does:

This is a simple command line noughts and crosses game.

 - You are a human, much like John Henry
 - Your opponent will be a machine, much like a Steam-Powered Drill
 - Your opponent will never lose, and will always play perfectly.(feature to be added)
 - Finally, you can feel what it's like to rage against the machine and never win!(feature to be added)

### How to play:

 1. Clone this repository (Or just copy the contents of the `source` folder into an empty one of your own)
 2. On the command line, cd into the directory the source files are in.
 3. $`python xox.py`

### How to test:

 1. Clone this repository
 2. On the command line, cd into the `xox` directory
 3. $`nosetests`

## Suggestions?

Have ideas about how I can better defeat you with this program? Is there a bug you'd like to report? A duplication you see? A feature to request? Or is the readme unclear? (I'm afraid I cannot accept any PRs beside my own because reasons.) But otherwise, all comments and help are welcome! <a href="https://github.com/IanDCarroll/tik-tak-toe/issues/new">Open up an issue!</a> :smile:
